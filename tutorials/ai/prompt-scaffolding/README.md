This setup allows you to scaffold a Java desktop app with JxBrowser for the
webview, a React UI (with shadcn/ui), and Protobuf/gRPC for communication
between Java and JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) 20.11.0 or higher
- [Cursor](https://cursor.com/)
- Claude 4 Sonnet

## How to use

Download the [`docs`](docs) and [`template`](template)
directories and put them into an empty project.

Add the [`architecture-overview.md`](docs/architecture-overview.md)
document to the context for a new project in Cursor, and ask the LLM to
generate the app using the prompt below:

![Paste the prompt in Cursor](img/paste-prompt-in-cursor.png)

Hereâ€™s the prompt to use:

```markdown
Please read and analyse the architecture in architecture-overview.md we've used
in our previous project, and let's create a new demo project from it.

Let's create a simple desktop application with the functionality of a basic
filesystem viewer. The front-end part will be responsible for displaying the
file system structure, like folders and files. The backend part will access the
Java filesystem API and provide the data to the front-end.
```

## How to run

When all the project files are generated, you can start the app by first running
the Vite dev server:

```bash
cd web-app
npm run dev
```

Then, in another terminal, launch the application itself:

```bash
./gradlew run
```

You should see the desktop app window with shadcn/ui (React) that allows viewing
local files/folders and navigating through them:

After the application successfully started, you can remove the [`docs`](docs)
and [`template`](template) directories.

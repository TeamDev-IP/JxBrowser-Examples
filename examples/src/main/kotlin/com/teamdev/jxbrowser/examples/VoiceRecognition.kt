/**
 * This example demonstrates how to enable voice recognition functionality
 * in Chromium engine.
 *
 * By default, the voice recognition functionality is disabled. To enable it,
 * you must provide your Google API keys to the Chromium engine as shown
 * in this example.
 *
 * The voice recognition functionality is provided by Google Cloud services,
 * in particular by Speech API. Follow the instruction below to enable it
 * and generate the required credentials.
 *
 * Enabling Speech API in Google Cloud:
 *
 * 1. Speech API is private. It is visible only to people subscribed
 *    to [chromium-dev](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/chromium-dev)
 *    Google Group. Join this group. When joining, make sure `Link to my Google account profile`
 *    check is set (you can opt out of emails).
 * 2. Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com).
 *    Make sure you are logged in with the Google account associated with
 *    the email address that you used to subscribe to "chromium-dev" group.
 * 3. In the top bar, create a new project for your app or select an existing one.
 * 4. Go to APIs & Services > Library.
 * 5. Find and enable "Speech API" (NOT "Cloud Speech-to-Text API").
 *    If there's no such API found, return to the "Library" page and choose
 *    "private" in "Visibility" section on the left. There will be all private
 *    APIs visible to you. Appearance of private APIs after subscribing
 *    to the group may take some time (up to 15 minutes).
 *
 * Acquiring Keys:
 *
 * 1. Go to APIs & Services > Credentials.
 * 2. Configure OAuth consent screen, if you haven't done it before.
 *    Fill in the product name (anything you choose) and other details, then save.
 * 3. Click "CREATE CREDENTIALS" button, select "OAuth client ID" item
 *    in the drop-down list. In the “Application type” select the type that
 *    better describes your app and give it a name, then click "Create".
 * 4. In the pop-up window that appears, you'll see "Client ID" and
 *    "Client secret" strings. Keep them. They should be passed to JxBrowser.
 * 5. Click "CREATE CREDENTIALS" button again on the same page.
 *    Choose "API key". A pop-over should show up giving you the API key string.
 *    It should also be passed to JxBrowser.
 *
 * See also: [Chromium Docs | API Keys](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/HEAD/docs/api_keys.md).
